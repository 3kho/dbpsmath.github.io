A unblocked game website that lets you play tons of games and has multiple proxies and is open source.

# Why should I use this?
Because of how easy this is to spin up and/or use, how many links I'm setting up currently, and how it is going to be updated frequently, this will be a great games website (and proxy website lol) 

# FAQ
## How did you make this
I used [BlazerHM's](https://www.github.com/beforeblazergithub/) template for making a unblocked games website, with the 3kh0 [3hk0-assets](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0-Assets) repository.
## Is there a tab cloaker?
Currently there is not a custom tab cloaker, however the games and proxy pages are automatically cloaked as Google, I'm soon making this so that all pages are cloaked as google
## How can I know that someone is you?
My discord ID is currently 810226107248803881.
## Are there bookmarklets?
I'm going to add those soon.

This is based on BlazerGames, a FOSS project by [BlazerHM](https://www.youtube.com/@BlazerHM).
The proxies are from BlazerHM's subscriber channels on discord and some are my personal proxies that I host.
The games are from [3hk0](https://github.com/3kh0)'s game assets repository.
I, DiamondBroPlayz am currently the only person working on this. If this changes then I will update this README.
